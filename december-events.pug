          | Join us on the Baptist Church forecourt in Mill Street from 11am for a joyful morning of Christingle making. Everyone is welcome to take part in this special Christmas tradition — a wonderful activity for families, children, and anyone who wants to share in the festive spirit. All materials will be provided, including oranges, candles, ribbons, and sweets, so you can make your own Christingle and reflect on the light and hope of Christmas in a warm community atmosphere. Drop in any time from 11am, but don’t wait too long — we’ll be making Christingles until the oranges run out.
